# Gullsy - Caw Caw!

> This a social media application similar to Twitter. Initially, I wanted to build this with PHP Laravel (Seagully), but Ruby and Rails is just much more fun. I'm using the following tools:

* Ruby 3.0.2
* Continuous Integration/Deployment: Github Actions/Heroku
* Ruby on Rails 6.1.4
* HTML5 and Sass
* PostgreSQL
* Testing: Minitest 5.14.4
* CSS Framework: Windi CSS
* Code Bundler: Vite Ruby

## Setup

How to run tests:

```
% rails test
```

How to run the development console:

```
% rails console
```

How to run the development server:

```
% rails server
```

How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:

```
% rails db:create

% rails db:migrate
```
