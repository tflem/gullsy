# Gullsy - Caw! Caw!

> A social media application similar to Twitter. I initially wanted to build this with PHP Laravel (Seagully), but Ruby and Rails is more fun. I'll use the following tools:

* Ruby 3.0.2
* Continuous Integration/Deployment: Github Actions/Heroku
* Ruby on Rails 6.1.4
* HTML5 and Sass
* PostgreSQL
* Code Bundler: Vite Ruby

## Setup

How to run tests:

```
% rspec spec
```

How to run the development console:

```
% rails console
```

How to run the development server:

```
% rails server
```

How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:

```
% rails db:create

% rails db:migrate
```
